# Conditional GAN Implementation using TensorFlow

This repository contains an implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) using TensorFlow. CGANs are an extension of GANs where the generator is conditioned on additional information, allowing for controlled generation of samples.

## Overview

In a traditional GAN, the generator generates samples from random noise vectors. In a CGAN, the generator also takes additional conditioning information as input, such as class labels. This allows for the generation of samples conditioned on specific attributes.
